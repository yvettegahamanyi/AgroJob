Section 1: Brainstorming and Discussion            

Session Summary
This session focused on brainstorming using the GCGO to come up with an opportunity and a challenge to work on as a group and we were refining project ideas to address job scarcity in Rwanda's agricultural sector. We began by generating a comprehensive list of potential solutions, ranging from applications for pest control and soil measurement to platforms for knowledge sharing and resource management. After figuring out what we wanted to work on we worked on the Requirement Specification Document.

List of all Possible Project Ideas


The application is responsible for posting chemical products that one can use in agriculture to reduce pests.
Application to connect skilled farmers with aspiring farming workers and landowners seeking tenants.
Application to measure the soil temperature for the farmer to know if the soil is wet or dry to know exactly which crop they prefer to use for their land.
Online platform for matching skilled farmers with aspiring agricultural workers.
Training programs for aspiring farmers to develop necessary skills.
A resource-sharing platform for agricultural equipment and tools.
Database of available farmland for lease or rent.
Mentorship programs connect experienced farmers with newcomers.

Final  Project Ideas (5 MAX) 
The application is responsible for posting chemical products that one can use in agriculture to reduce pests and connect the product owner to the farmer for improvement in agriculture.
Application to connect skilled farmers with aspiring farming workers and landowners seeking tenants for the farmers to know exactly where they can get available land they can use to start farming.
Application to measure the soil temperature for the farmer to know if the soil is wet or dry to know exactly which crop they prefer to use for their land.
Application to provide networking opportunities to support farmers and job seekers to investors can track the forms sponsored to help it in agriculture to develop job creates and opportunities for farmers.
Application to better facilities to provide working conditions for farmers increasing their comfort and safety.
[Note: Remember to include why each idea is feasible.]









Section 2: Project definition and requirements gathering

               
Bridging the Gap: Agriculture Job Creation Platform(AgroJob)
Background


In Rwanda, a significant challenge persists in job scarcity. With a national unemployment rate of 17%, particularly impacting young people (22.4%) and women (20.3%), many need more opportunities to contribute to the economy. The agricultural sector holds immense potential for job creation, but a significant barrier exists for new entrants. Aspiring farmers often need more skills, resources, and access to land. After profoundly understanding this problem, we devised a solution, AgroJob. We aim to address the challenge of job creation in the agricultural sector by connecting skilled farmers with aspiring farming workers and landowners seeking tenants. The platform aims to:

Increase employment opportunities: Empowering individuals to enter the agricultural workforce.
Empower new farmers: Equipping aspiring farmers with the skills and resources to succeed.
Optimize land use: Connecting landowners with potential tenants, ensuring productive land use.
Enhance agricultural knowledge transfer: Bridging the gap between experienced farmers and new entrants by fostering knowledge sharing.

Purpose of this Document:

This Requirement Specification Document (RSD) outlines the functionalities and features required for the AgroJob to succeed. This document serves as a roadmap for the project team, ensuring:

    A clear understanding of project goals
    Efficient development process
    Requirements and constraints


General Project Description

AgroJob is a menu-driven application in Python that connects skilled farmers with aspiring agricultural workers and landowners seeking tenants. The platform will address the challenge of job creation in the agricultural sector by providing the following functionalities:

Create crop resource guides: skilled farmers will create profiles for different crops available to anyone who wants to learn about those crops and start cultivating them.
Create landowner profiles: different land owners will create their profiles for the aspiring farmers to choose from the list according to their preferences.
Display information: the system will have the primary function of displaying all this information beautifully to make it easy for the reader to be able to get something out of our system 

Target Users:

    Skilled Farmers
    Aspiring Agricultural Workers
    Landowners

Design Constraints
In this section, think as a group about any limitations you may face as you work on the project. Limitations may be in terms of software, hardware, or Skills
***Example: For this project, we will only use the Python programming language. The program will not have a GUI. Users will interact with the program in the terminal of the Pycharm IDE that will be used for the implementation. ***

Technology Limitations:
The project will be developed solely using Python.
The application will be command-line-based without a graphical user interface (GUI), and users will interact with it through the terminal.

Third-Party Dependencies:
The platform may need to integrate with third-party services or APIs to retrieve land information, such as land size, location, and availability.
Dependence on third-party services may introduce complexities in data privacy, reliability, and service availability.

Limited Resources:
Constraints on hardware resources, such as server capacity and memory, may impact system performance, especially during peak usage periods.
Limited budget or access to cloud services may restrict scalability and infrastructure improvements.

Skills and Expertise:
The development team's proficiency in Python and relevant technologies may vary, affecting the speed and quality of implementation.
Acquiring specialized skills or knowledge, such as expertise in the agricultural domain or backend development, may need to be improved.

Resource Constraints:
Development resources, including time and budget, may need to be improved, requiring careful prioritization of features and functionalities. 

Project Plan for AgroJob:
